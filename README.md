phpcaptcha
==========

This is an old module originally developed for 2.3.  I had to do some minor tweaks to make it compatible with 3.0.5.  Unlike Captcha by google, phpcaptcha is easier to read and simple which means it is client friendly.

The original module can be downloaded from http://www.silverstripe.org/phpcaptcha-module/
